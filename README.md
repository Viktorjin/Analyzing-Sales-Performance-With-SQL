# Analyzing-Sales-Performance-With-SQL
 
 In this project, we need to answer allowing questions:
* What's the most popular album / Genre in USA?
* Who is the most productive sales support agent?
* Where are customer comes from? Which country has the most customers?
* How much our customer spended on average per order?
* What's the percentage of customers who purchase full ablum? 
* Shall we need to keep both purchase options open? (Full ablum & Tracks)

We will use SQL to extract sales data from chinook database and deliver insights to answer these questions above.
